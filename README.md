# CryptoData

This is a mini project to get the top 400 crypto ticker information from coinmarketcap. And then for each crypto, get the historical data (from Jan 1st 2017) as well as the exchanges it is listed on.

The output of the python file is 3 CSV files that are directly pushed to this Github repo. 

This is perfect for data science projects. In Tableau or Power BI or Kaggle Kernal you can use this as data source.
